/*
		you really created a skeleton of things u didnt get well during the summer training. tbh i think you really understood what its like to create an app. 
	you know the layout, the structure. now its time to learn how to optimize it. to pubhish it. 

		-	learn git
		-	learn how to scale/optimize
		-	CI/CD and AWS
		-	improve frontend
		-	build a portfolio
		-	leetcode

	Rn u know how to create ur own app without a help. u didnt watch tutorials for this app. u made it on your own. u got help from gpt and previous projects. but 
	u knew what to make of it. u really improved a lot in this past 3 years as a programmer. and i still managed to drop down to 10 lessons in the first 
	half of third year. if i dont fuck up, its gonna end in 3.5 years. i would very much like to get a GPA above 2.7 too. and as i continue to improve my traits, 
	i believe we can be jobbable in 1 year. dont worry about askerlik. its 3 weeks. even if u get approved to a job, u can just come back for 3 weeks using all your
	holidays. they give you a temp diploma to start applying. in 1 year, u can start applying to berlin.
